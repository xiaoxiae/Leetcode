# Leetcode
My solutions to Leetcode problems, written (mostly) in Python.

The files are automatically generated and submited using clearloop's [`leetcode-cli`](https://github.com/clearloop/leetcode-cli) written in Rust, which I definitely recommend (in favour of skygragon's more popular [`leetcode-cli`](https://github.com/skygragon/leetcode-cli) written in JavaScript, which is utterly broken).

## Solved problems
- **Easy:** 36
- **Medium:** 14
- **Hard:** 4
